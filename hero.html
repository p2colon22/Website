<p>The heroes that I chose are the firefighter in our area here in Carmel Valley. Firefighters are people whose job is to fight fires and use leadership skills to save peoples homes. They put their own lives at risk every day that they are called in to work and they are people who are willing to sacrifice for the greater good of others. There are several firefighters in Carmel Valley due to the common occurence of fires in the area. They have saved hundreds of peoples' homes and futures and their light in this world will only continue to shine and save others from natural disasters.</p>

<p>I chose the firefighters to be my hero because they have actually changed my life in real impactful ways. While their is not a singular firefighter who is my hero, many of them prevented my two of my families houses from being burned down in the Carmel Fire. These firefighters are people who have changed my families lives and allowed us to keep precious posessions and memories that would have otherwise been lost. The true benevelence that the firefighters showed me and my family is wonderful and amazing. I will forever be thankful to these firefighters and they will always be my heroes no matter how many of them there are. Thank you firefigthers :)<p/>
